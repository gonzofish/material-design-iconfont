# Material design iconfont

This is a fork of the [Material design icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons) from Google. In this fork, only the iconfont is provided
so that it can be incorporated into projects more easily.

## Updates

I make no guarantees about staying in sync with Google's updates to the font, but I'll do my best. I may not be the hero you deserve.
